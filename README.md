# Snatcher-MSX-keyboard-overlay-for-Retroach
A keyboard overlay, fit to play Snatcher (MSX) on [Retroach](https://www.retroarch.com/), using [bluemsx](https://docs.libretro.com/library/bluemsx/) core.

There's 3 overlays:

1 - Keyboard: a keyboard with only the keys needed to play the majority of the game: Esc, Ctrl, Shift, Spacebar, 0-9 and Return.

2 - Joypad: a 9-way joypad and an 'action button' (that need to be hold to fire the gun), for the action scenes

3 - Full Keyboard: a fully functional MSX keyboard, useful to use the Junqer HQ computer.

The's also a 'Fast Forward' button for convenience.

# Notes
Based on Retroarch Overlay 'keyboard/commodore/plus4.cfg'.
Created with [Retropad Editor](https://valent-in.github.io/retropad-editor/).

The overlay mimics (a little bit) the japanese Toshiba HX10D layout.
